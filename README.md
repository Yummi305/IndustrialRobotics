## How to run simulation
Run startup_rvc.m within the Robotics Toolbox
Run FruitLoop.mlapp within the Apps folder.
This will open up the app and provide you with the option of running the system autonomously or manually.
Options are enabled on start up. Actions that you cannot take (yet) will be disabled until appropriate.
